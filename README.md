# Group_4_Project_2
Project 2 Repository for Group 4

Current status/ meeting notes:
We have voluntereed for the following breakup of subsections:

Angelo:  Create the Category and Subcategory DataFrames
Ashley:  Create the Campaign DataFrame
Natalie: Create the Contacts DataFrame
Shannon: Create the Crowdfunding Database

If we get stuck for more than 30 minutes on anything, send out a group text for a spare set of eyes to get a fresh look.

Upload your work to the repository, especially if you are stuck. That way we can do a pull and debug locally.
